Open up to Open-Source

## What is Open Source?
Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

## why does Open Source matter?
Open source software matters to everyone, not just programmers, because it unlocks the potential of many more people to become innovators than a closed-source model. Open source communities, for instance, are organized around open source projects where anyone with skills can join and contribute code.

The open source way is so effective because it can attract tremendous technical talent. Much of the innovation in technology is taking place in the open source community, and people all over the world end up using open source
